# Bezier-Editor
This program can create and render bezier curves with an arbitrary amount of control points. The program was made to be easy to use and to allow the user to create curves with an image in the background as a template. It is possible to add, move and remove control points to affect the shape of the curves. When a curve is finished it can be saved to a file using the menu bar in the editor.

## File format
The curves are saved to text files (with .points as the file extension) with one line for each control point. Each line consists of the x and y values of the control point, where the y-axis points downwards (due to how the coordinates are handled in the editor).
